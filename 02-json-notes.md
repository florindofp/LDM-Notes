## 🟢 **What is JSON?**

**JSON** is a lightweight data-interchange format. It’s used to store and exchange data between a server and a client (like a website and a backend database).

💬 **You can tell your students:**
> "If you've ever used a dictionary in Python or an object in JavaScript, you've already seen something that looks a lot like JSON. It's just a way to organize data using keys and values."

## 🧱 **Basic Structure of JSON**

A JSON document is made up of **key-value pairs**, like this:

```json
{
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "isStudent": false
}
```

### 🔑 Keys:
- Always **strings**.
- Written in **double quotes**.

### 📦 Values:
Can be:
- **Strings**: `"Hello"`
- **Numbers**: `42`, `3.14`
- **Booleans**: `true`, `false`
- **Null**: `null`
- **Objects** (another set of key-value pairs)
- **Arrays** (a list of values)

## 🪄 **JSON Example with All Types**

```json
{
  "firstName": "Sarah",
  "age": 22,
  "isGraduate": true,
  "address": {
    "city": "New York",
    "zip": "10001"
  },
  "hobbies": ["Reading", "Coding", "Hiking"],
  "nickname": null
}
```

### Let’s break it down:
- `"firstName"` is a string.
- `"age"` is a number.
- `"isGraduate"` is a boolean.
- `"address"` is a nested object (another JSON inside).
- `"hobbies"` is an array (a list).
- `"nickname"` is null (empty value).

## 💭 **Think of JSON Like...**

> “Imagine JSON as a storage box where each drawer is labeled (that’s the key), and inside each drawer is something useful (that’s the value). You can have small boxes inside (nested objects), and lists of things too (arrays). It’s organized, tidy, and easy to search.”

## 🛠️ **How JSON is Used in the Real World**

- 🕸️ Web APIs: When your browser asks a server for data, the response is often in JSON.
- 🗄️ Config Files: Many programs store their settings in `.json` files.
- 🔌 Databases: NoSQL databases like MongoDB use JSON-like structures to store data.

## 🧪 **Practice Time!**
Have students take this table and write it as JSON:

| Name   | Age | Major        | GPA  |
|--------|-----|--------------|------|
| Alice  | 21  | Computer Sci | 3.9  |

### ✅ JSON Version:
```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "age": 21,
  "major": "Computer Science",
  "gpa": 3.9
}
```

Let them play with it. Maybe add a list of courses or include contact info as a nested object!

## 🧠 **🎯 Analogy Quiz: "What's the JSON equivalent?"**

**Instructions:** Match the real-world item to the correct JSON structure.

---

### 📝 **Question 1: A student ID card**

What does this look like in JSON?

**Real-world details:**
- Name: Jamie
- ID: 12345
- Grade: 10

**A.**  
```json
["Jamie", 12345, 10]
```

**B.**  
```json
{
  "name": "Jamie",
  "id": 12345,
  "grade": 10
}
```

**C.**  
```json
<student><name>Jamie</name><id>12345</id><grade>10</grade></student>
```

✅ **Correct Answer: B**  
JSON uses **key-value pairs**, not just lists or tags like XML.

### 📝 **Question 2: A pizza order**

What JSON object matches this order?

- Type: Margherita
- Size: Medium
- Toppings: ["Olives", "Mushrooms"]

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "type": "Margherita",
  "size": "Medium",
  "toppings": ["Olives", "Mushrooms"]
}
```

---

### 📝 **Question 3: An empty notebook**

How would you represent this in JSON?

- No name
- No content

**Answer:**
```json
{
  "name": null,
  "content": ""
}
```

📌 `null` means *no value at all*, while `""` is an *empty string*.

## 🧩 **🧭 Visual Diagram: "The JSON House"**

Use a house analogy on a whiteboard or slide. Here’s the concept:

### 🏠 **JSON House**

```
{
  "house": {
    "owner": "Linda",
    "rooms": 3,
    "garage": true,
    "pets": ["dog", "cat"],
    "address": {
      "street": "123 Main St",
      "city": "Springfield"
    }
  }
}
```

**Visual Aid Breakdown:**

| Part of House        | JSON Representation     | Analogy                 |
|----------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Whole House          | `{ ... }`               | The main container      |
| Owner Name           | `"owner": "Linda"`      | A label on the door     |
| Number of Rooms      | `"rooms": 3`            | Info on a clipboard     |
| Pets                 | `"pets": [ ... ]`       | A list in the fridge    |
| Address              | `"address": { ... }`    | Another box inside      |
